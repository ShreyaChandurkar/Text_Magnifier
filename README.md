# Text_Magnifier

I have developed a feature using Java that allows text displayed on the screen to be zoomed in, which I believe will be particularly useful for seniors aged 65 and over.

I recognized that many seniors use spectacles all day, which can be tiring and inconvenient for them. By implementing this feature, seniors will no longer need to wear their spectacles all the time. They will be able to read news or view anything on their smartphones without straining their eyes.

I am excited about the potential impact this feature can have on the lives of seniors and hope it will make their daily lives easier and more comfortable. I believe this feature is an excellent example of how technology can be used to improve the quality of life for all individuals, regardless of age or ability.
